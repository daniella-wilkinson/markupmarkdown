# Region 1

## Pokémon Type Distribution

```{r type.distribution}
#| echo: false

ggplot(region.type.1, aes(x = Type)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#DD544E") +
  ggtitle("Pokémon Type Distribution in Kanto") +
  labs(x = "Pokemon Type", y = "Frequency") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Understanding the distribution of Pokémon types across different regions provides valuable insight into how geography and environment shape the Pokémon world. By analyzing type frequency by region, we can identify patterns in how certain types thrive in specific landscapes. For example, water types are more prevalent in island regions like Alola, while rock- and ground types dominate arid areas like Hoenn's deserts and Sinnoh's mountainous terrain. This analysis highlights the ecological diversity within each region and deepens our understanding of how Pokémon adapt to their surroundings.

Beyond identifying patterns, this analysis enhances strategic decision-making for trainers and researchers. Understanding which types are most common in each region can help trainers anticipate challenges, build balanced teams, and appreciate the environmental influences on Pokémon availability. For researchers, these insights provide a deeper look into how the Pokémon world mirrors real-world biodiversity, reinforcing the connection between habitat, adaptation, and survival. By engaging with this data, users can uncover new perspectives on the Pokémon universe and explore the dynamic relationship between nature and Pokémon distribution.

## Pokémon Stat Distribution

### Total

```{r total.distribution}
#| echo: false

ggplot(region.1, aes(x = Total)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "#DD544E", color = "white", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Pokémon Power Distribution in Kanto",
    x = "Total Power",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Analyzing the stat distributions of Pokémon across regions is essential for understanding how strength, rarity, and battle potential vary based on geography and environmental factors. By examining the spread of Pokémon stats within different regions, we can identify patterns in how certain characteristics dominate specific landscapes. For example, regions with harsh terrains, such as Sinnoh’s mountains or Hoenn’s volcanic areas, may host more resilient and high-powered Pokémon. In contrast, temperate regions may feature a more balanced distribution of strength and defense levels. This analysis highlights the competitive diversity within each region and deepens our understanding of how Pokémon ecosystems develop in response to their surroundings.

Beyond recognizing patterns, analyzing stat distributions is crucial in strategy and game balance. Trainers can use this data to anticipate regional challenges, optimize their teams, and understand the difficulty curve when traveling between areas. For researchers, studying stat distributions offers insight into how Pokémon populations are structured, revealing the interplay between strength, adaptation, and survival. Engaging with this data allows users to explore the Pokémon world through a new lens, uncovering the strategic and ecological factors influencing Pokémon availability and regional competitiveness.
