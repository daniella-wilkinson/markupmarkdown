# Pokédex

Understanding the distribution of Pokémon types across different regions provides valuable insight into how geography and environment shape the Pokémon world. By analyzing type frequency by region, we can identify patterns in how certain types thrive in specific landscapes. For example, water types are more prevalent in island regions like Alola, while rock- and ground types dominate arid areas like Alola's.

## Pokémon Type Distribution

```{r type.dist}
#| eval: false
#| include: false
ggplot(reg_type.7, aes(x = Type)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#3DB2FF") +
  ggtitle("Pokémon Type Distribution in Alola") +

This demonstration explores the distribution of Pokémon types across different regions, revealing how geography and environment influence the Pokémon world. By analyzing type frequency by region, users can identify patterns in how certain types thrive in specific landscapes. The interactive visualizations allow trainers to compare regional ecosystems, uncover trends, and gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between Pokémon habitats and their elemental traits. Designed for educators, researchers, and enthusiasts, this resource bridges the gap between game-play and data analysis, offering an engaging and accessible way to explore Pokémon metadata.

Understanding the distribution of Pokémon types across different regions provides valuable insight into how geography and environment shape the Pokémon world. By analyzing type frequency by region, we can identify patterns in how certain types thrive in specific landscapes. For example, water types are more prevalent in island regions like Alola, while rock- and ground types dominate arid areas like Alola's deserts and Alola's mountainous terrain. This analysis highlights the ecological diversity within each region and deepens our understanding of how Pokémon adapt to their surroundings.

Beyond identifying patterns, this analysis enhances strategic decision-making for trainers and researchers. Understanding which types are most common in each region can help trainers anticipate challenges, build balanced teams, and appreciate the environmental influences on Pokémon availability. For researchers, these insights provide a deeper look into how the Pokémon world mirrors real-world biodiversity, reinforcing the connection between habitat, adaptation, and survival. By engaging with this data, users can uncover new perspectives on the Pokémon universe and explore the dynamic relationship between nature and Pokémon distribution.
