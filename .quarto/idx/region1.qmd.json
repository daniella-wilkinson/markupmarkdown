Its landscape features a mix of urban and rural environments, with densely populated cities, small countryside towns, vast forests, and coastal routes. The region’s topography is relatively straightforward, with no extreme geographical features like mountains or deserts. Kanto has a structured, grid-like design, reflecting early Pokémon games’ simplicity. Verdant forests like Viridian and coastal areas like Cinnabar Island contribute to the region’s biodiversity. At the same time, the presence of man-made locations like the Power Plant, a key source of energy for the region, and Pokémon Mansion, a symbol of wealth and technological advancement, highlight a blend of nature and industrialization.\n\nThe region’s inspiration draws from early post-war Japan, where urban expansion and technological advancement reshaped the landscape. This can be seen in locations such as Saffron City, a significant metropolis housing the mighty Silph Co., and Celadon City, which boasts a massive department store and a casino. The emphasis on scientific research, seen in Cinnabar’s Pokémon Lab and Mewtwo’s creation, aligns with Japan’s rapid technological growth. Kanto’s simple but structured environment reflects an era of transformation, where nature coexists with emerging urban development, setting the stage for later, more diverse Pokémon regions.\n\n\n```{r pokedex.setup.1}\n#| include: false\n\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(reactable)\n\n###############################################################################################\n\npokedex <- read.csv(\"pokedex.csv\");
